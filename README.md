[Zuck's path to the Metaverse](https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/05/tech/meta-facebook-crossroads/index.html)

### Summary
I find this article to be interesting because it talks about Facebook/Meta's current struggles and how they may attempt to overcome them. The article also talks about how Meta's plans for the metaverse aren't set in stone, and it may not work out for them. I find the part about "an undefined path to the metaverse" interesting because I started to think about the kind of software engineering work needed to happen to make the 'metaverse' work. The article also mentions some of the problems they have with generational usage, which made me think maybe they need better front-end engineers to help with the interface to bring on younger generations.
